	     <div id="d1">
		 <p id="p1">The Shawshank Redemption</p>
         <p id="p12">Based on a Stephen King story, the film is told over several years at the titular prison and centers on a friendship between two inmates. The relationship between the two men is one of the most heart-warming friendships ever shown on screen and it helps give the film those beautiful moments which lead up to one of the greatest endings in film history.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
		<div id="d2">
		<p id="p2">The Godfather</p>
		<p id="p22">This is the story of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family who struggle with maintaining power after their patriarch is nearly assassinated. The film is violent, funny, intense, emotional and so much more. There are countless quotable lines and unforgettable sequences. It's no wonder it is regarded as such an inspiring film to so many of today's best film-makers.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"> 
			<div id="d3">
			
        <p id="p3"> The Godfather: Part II</p>
       <p id="p32"> Without Marlon Brando returning for his iconic role, the film tells the story of young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro who makes the role his own. Along with those amazing flashback scenes, the sequel follows Michael's further decent into the world of crime and his complicated relationship with his brother Fredo. A brilliant continuation and a masterpiece in its own right</p>
